<header><h2>It's not really a list tho it's more of a paragraph</h2></header>
<p>My hobbies are not that <i>speciall</i>.the first one is watching youtube.i mainly use youtube for religion perposes and entertainment,other than that i have nothing to do. since i'm a highschool student,i use most of my free time studing for a test or quizes,doing homework,assignments,projects and so on. (the last one is a lie, i wanted the paragraph to be longer)</p>
<p>sometimes i question my excistence and my well being or what will i do or happen in the future.
it's not like i worry about it or anything, it's just some random thought that i think about often. i don't recommend getting
lost in thought because it brings those weird fantasies and dark thoughts that we all experinced before.</p>
<p>my other hobbie is learning to design websites.obviously.</p>
