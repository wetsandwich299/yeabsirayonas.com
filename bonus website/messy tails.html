<p>This is a story about a person whom GOD loved and created that loves eating feaces. yes. Another sad perverse human actions
that is influenced by satan. This person loves to eat feaces, It doesn't matter if it's another animal's feaces, he loves all wastes equally. He likes it wet, solid, 
green, brown, dark who cares! And the most fun part is that he likes to cook with it. mmm...oh yes! he experimented by cooking his poop with oats and perfectly executed it. 
Even the chopped judges wouldn't stand a chance against his scrumptious shart.<br>


<p>He doesn't want to stop his desires and fantasies about poop. he can't stop himself oh no...he wants to be psychologically, irreversibly addicted to poop. All jokes
aside i thought he was dead but the last time i checked his last tweet was in 2021 saying that he's back from the mental hospital and still addicted to consuming feaces.
This guy needs to be gone. Seriously. How is he still alive after consuming more than 2 years worth of poop! Did i also mention that he likes to 
brag about how fat he is? OBVIOUSLY NOT! imagine him living in his appartment wearing his fursuit for GOD knows how long and casually crapping himself deliberetly and consuming it
like it's a small snack for dinner. i don't want to bring this up but he also uses 'hole stretcher'or (whatever you call it) so he can get lose and crap freely without holding it back.
<p>I don't know how he's still alive. May the lord forgive me but i hope he dies and gets instant judegment in the firey pit where he belongs. There is no meaning of his excistence, 
NONE. All he does is eat shit, talk shit and fantasise about shit. Shit for him is like water for us, he can't live with out it. He's also gay by the way, he fantasieses
about "F"ing a dude when that was about to take a dump. Words can't describe how revolting this man is...i don't even want to call him a man he's an animal. OH i almost forgot that he is
a pet-ophile too. If you don't know what that means it's zoophilia (having the desire to mate with animals or become attracted to animals). Sometimes i wonder, who is this guy? how does he live like this
and feels zero guilt or even embarassed sharing this to the world? That is not a sane person's behaviour. Obviously something is very wrong
with this guy but how much tho? does he have a limit? a boundery that he doesn't want to cross? who knows?

<p>I might do a little research on him just to understand him a bit better. How messed up he is. He has dozens of tweets and i want to read every single word that he posted.
I doubt it that i won't be reading all of it but at least i will read half of it, AT LEAST. But here's what i've got so far, i can't put the original image here but i will illustrate it using mspaint
so be easy on me here.<br><br><br><br>

<img src="..\img\paw.png" width="300" height="300" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right">

<p>As you can see in this poorly drawn illustration, messy tailes posted a photo of his messy 'paw' were he craped on his hands, holds the turd in his hands and squezzed it like it's playdogh. I shit you not when i tell you
that there were lots and lots of poop in those photos. But he didn't stop there oh no no no...he licks it and brings a 'strange shaped rubber', mixed it with his feces, put's it back in his butt, crapped in it, pulls it out and 
licks it clean like it was a popstickle on a hot sunny day. His poop has this hydrated dough consistency. Like if you were making a donut for example and you put less flour while mixing it and it gets semi solid and gets stuck in your hands you know what i mean? 

<p>Anyway, there's another photo of him in his fursuit head submerged in his devine poop and oats delicacy. Despite how mouth watering it sounds, he hates it
because he can taste the 'oats' in the poopn'oats. He would rather lick the poop out of the 'strange shaped rubber' because he likes the taste of rubber instead of oats.
Yeah that definetly makes sense, from the mouth of the chef himself. Gordon ramsey whould be proud of him for sure.

<p>So there you have it, you've learned something today. I don't know what it might be but you surely got something from this website.
weather it's disgust, shock, saddness, laughter or depression. You're welcome.
