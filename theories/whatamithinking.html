<u><h3>personality shopping</h3></u>
<li><p>Don't get me wrong, social media is not entirely "bad" it depends on how we use it. but obviously we're selfish worthless creatures so the majority
of social media users are toxic. it's all about them and the rest can admire and worship their appearence or physical body. not only that but
most of them are brainwashed by models and celebreties. they want to be like them, act like them, dresslike them, talk like them, think like them, walk like them, laugh like them and so on...
and worst part is vanity! oh i hate vanity so much, it makes you feel insecure about yourself and it also makes you compare yourself with others based on apearence. it makes you jelous and envious.
<br>
</li>
<u><h3>Unnessesary time wasting</h3></u>
<li>We've all been there before, we've all wasted our time on social media platform. We can't get enough of videos and content and we just keep scrolling and scrolling.
i think it's called  <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine"><i>dopamine</i> </a> a drug that is responsible for gluing our minds to our phones. i don't have enough knowledge or information to talk about dopamine yet so hopefully
i will code it with a link that goes to the meaning of the word. if i didn't, then that means that i'm lazy or still trying to figure it out. i don't want to talk about it too deeply since we all know
the feeling and the side effects of being on your phone too much.<br>

<li>I've been obssed with this for a while now. i've gathered some evidences that supports my theory on MBTI tests. These 16 personality
test is FAKE, it has darker meaning and intentions behind it that were over looked.i just gone through my phone and took the test right after
i typed the last 2 sentences. anyways...that's not the point here, MBTI is a dumb little test made by an old man who believes in the evolution.
it's basically astrology but worse. GOD perfected us with our own special and unique personalities. i want to type more but i don't feel like
it anymore since i've covered this topic on my laptop with 3 videos (the 4th one is on the way). this is enough for now. if you're wondering
the evidences are on my phone and i can't send the images on this website because of laziness (you probably don't care anyway). And one more thing, there is a webtoon
about these 16 types as collage/university students made by another delutional LGBTQRSTUVWXYZ+ member. the funny part is that she drew all female characters
with flat melons and cheeks EXCEPT for her type. i can't send the photo here so i'm gonna draw an illustration with ms paint.

</li><br><br><br><br><br>
<li align="left"> the hole webtoon is all about her being all cute and blush all over and getting all the boys attention with her"cuitness"
and all that sort of crap.
