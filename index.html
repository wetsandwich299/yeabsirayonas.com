<ul>
<li>Everyone has the right to do stupid things, but you’re abusing that privilege.</li>
<li>Common sense is like deodorant. The people who need it most never use it.</li>
<li>Whoever said nothing is impossible never tried slamming a revolving door.</li>
<li>I would like to thank my arms for always being by my side, my legs for always supporting me, and my fingers because I can always count on them.</li>
<li>In politics stupidity is not a handicap.</li>
<li>I am so clever that sometimes I don’t understand a single word of what I am saying.</li>
<li>I walk around as though everything is fine, but deep down, on my right calf, my sock is sliding down.</li>
<li>Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can’t see.</li>
<li>alex i hope you cry for his mercy and forgiveness cuz he won't forget what you've done.</li>
